;; The whole purpose of this file is to calculate the coefficients of a n-th
;; order stencil. We do this in lisp, since it supports fractional numbers and
;; big integers, so factorial is not a problem.
;;
;; Usage: load/compile everything, then call
;;
;; (stencil-coeff N)
;;
;; where N is the order of the stencil (must be even). This is the power of h
;; (mesh step) to which the taylor expansion is correct
;;
;; (stencil-coeff 2) produces #(1 -2 1), which is the central difference
;; operator of second order (in 1D):
;;   1 * u[x+1] -2 * u[x] + 1 * u[x-1]
;;
;; (stencil-coeff 4) produces 4th order stencil in 1D:
;; -1/12 * (u[x+2] -16*u[x+1] +30*u[x] -16*u[x-1] + u[x-2])
;;
;; and so on.
;; 
;; In order to do this for 2D and 3D, just multiply the central coefficient *
;; 2, respectively 3.
